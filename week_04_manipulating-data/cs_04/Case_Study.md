# Introduction

Going over the data I was able to find the answers to some of the questions. In my first metric I decided to use a summary to describe the data. I looked at the average arrival delay for each one of the airports. According to the data it looks like Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) comes in last. Next I filtered the data into just delta airlines to see which airport has the least amount of late arrivals. I created an late column, and then made the individual observation. 



## Which destination airport is the worst airport for arrival time? (you decide on the metric for "worst").

If we look at the graph we can see that the Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) has on average the longest delay in arrival time. 

## Which origin airport is best to minimize my chances of a late arrival when I am using Delta Airlines?
