```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
pivot_longer(cars,c(speed,dist))
pivot_wider(cars,c(speed,dist))
View(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
colnames(relig_income)
new_tibble <- pivot_longer(relig_income, cols =  `<$10k`:`Don't know/refused`,names_to = "income", values_to = "count" )
View(new_tibble)
```

```{r}
View(fish_encounters)
?pivot_wider

pivot_wider(fish_encounters,id_cols= fish, names_from = station, values_from = seen, values_fill = 0)
```
